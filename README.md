Simple playlist table with pagination, sorting, variable rows quantity and filters.

Visit the [deployed app](http://lastavenka.github.io/playlist).

Notes:

* Material-UI package is used for styling (although I have experiense in creating of UI components from the scratch).

* Data for the table is generated randomly and fetch request delay is imitated by timeout setting.

* All components are covered by unit tests.

* As I've been working on the project on my own, I've commited directly to master branch, but it's not my usual behaviour :)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
