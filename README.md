Simple playlist table with pagination, sorting, variable rows quantity and filters.

Visit the [deployed app](https://playlist-client.herokuapp.com/).

Notes:

* Material-UI package is used for styling (although I have experience in creating of UI components from the scratch).

* Data for the table is fetched from a small test server, that I've created for this project with Node.js. Data is generated randomly for each request.

* All components are covered by unit tests.

* As I've been working on the project on my own, I've commited directly to master branch, but it's not my usual behaviour :)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
